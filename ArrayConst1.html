<h2>JavaScript const</h2>
In 2015, JavaScript introduced an important new keyword: const.

It has become a common practice to declare arrays using const:
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

const cars = ["Mercedes", "Volvo", "BMW"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;

</script>
</body>
</html>
